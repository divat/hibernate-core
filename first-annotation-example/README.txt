Installation tips
------------------------
1)

The projects make use of Maven to define library dependencies. If you know maven, you don't need to read further.

2)

If you like to try out Maven now, you could install maven now and run
mvn dependency:resolve
to load the libraries from the Maven repositories.

3)

If you don't want to use Maven, you don't have to. The first example in the introduction part, explains where to download the JARS and which one to add to the lib folder.
